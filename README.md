 🌍 College Finder API Project
This project is a simple web application where users can enter a country name, and the app will return a list of all the colleges/universities located in that country. The app utilizes an API to fetch the college data and display it to the user.

💻 Technologies Used
HTML: For structuring the webpage
CSS: For styling and design
JavaScript: For the core functionality and interacting with the API
API: For fetching college data based on user input
⚙️ How It Works
The user enters a random country name in the input field.
Upon submission, the app fetches all the college names from that country using an external API.
The colleges are displayed on the page in a clean, organized list.
🚀 Upcoming Update
I’m planning an updated version of this project soon with additional features like:

Better user interface and design improvements.
Error handling for invalid inputs.
Enhanced search options, allowing filtering by state or city within a country.
Stay tuned for more! 🎉
